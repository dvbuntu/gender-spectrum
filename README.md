# Stress vs Gender Identity Explanations

Gender is a complex multi-faceted expression of many factors not fully captured by a binary "Female" or "Male".  It is still a gross simplification, but suppose we would project what we call gender to a single dimension from Masculine (on the left, say) to Feminine (on the right).  On the far left is ultra masculine, to use western stereotypes: loving sports, excessive drinking, body hair, giving strong handshakes, etc.  As we move to the right, these behaviors moderate and become more feminine (again, to use stereotypes: wearing dresses, being more emotionally supportive, being a mom, speaking with a higher pitch, etc).

<-Very Masc----Masc----Non Binary----Fem----Very Fem->
```

Consider where you might be on this axis.  Do you present mostly female, but not entirely?  Do behaviors/traits associated with other parts of the spectrum make you uncomfortable?  For example, maybe you are a woman but have some amount of body hair.  Whenever you notice it, you experience stress from something that is associated with being masculine.  Or maybe there was a time you were forced to wear a dress, something more feminine than you prefer.
